# Tmux Resurrect - Nvim Fork!

## What's New in This Fork üöÄ

This fork of **tmux-resurrection** brings a smoother, more efficient workflow for **Neovim** users who want their sessions seamlessly integrated with tmux! üòé

### Key Features:
- **‚ú® Neovim Session Support**: This version adds automatic support for **persistence.nvim**, which means your Neovim sessions will now load and restore automatically with tmux. Other session managers should work, but **persistence.nvim** is the only one that's been tested so far. Don‚Äôt worry if yours isn‚Äôt supported ‚Äî it‚Äôs likely easy to add!
  
- **üíæ Autosave Your Session**: To make sure your session is always up to date, you‚Äôll want to save frequently. We recommend adding this `autocmd` to your `init.lua` or `init.vim` for auto-saving:

  ```lua
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(
    { "BufWinLeave", "BufWritePost", "WinLeave", "TabLeave" },
    {
      group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("PersistenceAutoSave", { clear = true }),
      callback = function()
        require("persistence").save()
      end,
    }
  )
  ```

  This will ensure that your session saves whenever you switch buffers, windows, or tabs ‚Äî no more worrying about losing progress! üíæ‚ú®

- **üõ†Ô∏è Future Git Branch Saving**: Right now, git branch saves aren‚Äôt supported, but it‚Äôs on the way! Stay tuned for this feature in the near future. üìÖ

With these updates, tmux and Neovim will work together like never before ‚Äî saving you time, keeping your sessions safe, and making your workflow smoother. Enjoy the ride! üöÄ

P.S. It works great with [Tmux Continuum!](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum)

# Tmux Resurrect

Restore `tmux` environment after system restart.

Tmux is great, except when you have to restart the computer. You lose all the
running programs, working directories, pane layouts etc.
There are helpful management tools out there, but they require initial
configuration and continuous updates as your workflow evolves or you start new
projects.

`tmux-resurrect` saves all the little details from your tmux environment so it
can be completely restored after a system restart (or when you feel like it).
No configuration is required. You should feel like you never quit tmux.

It even (optionally)
[restores vim and neovim sessions](docs/restoring_vim_and_neovim_sessions.md)!

Automatic restoring and continuous saving of tmux env is also possible with
[tmux-continuum](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum) plugin.

### About

This plugin goes to great lengths to save and restore all the details from your
`tmux` environment. Here's what's been taken care of:

- all sessions, windows, panes and their order
- current working directory for each pane
- **exact pane layouts** within windows (even when zoomed)
- active and alternative session
- active and alternative window for each session
- windows with focus
- active pane for each window
- "grouped sessions" (useful feature when using tmux with multiple monitors)
- programs running within a pane! More details in the
  [restoring programs doc](docs/restoring_programs.md).

Optional:

- [restoring vim and neovim sessions](docs/restoring_vim_and_neovim_sessions.md)
- [restoring pane contents](docs/restoring_pane_contents.md)
- [restoring a previously saved environment](docs/restoring_previously_saved_environment.md)

Requirements / dependencies: `tmux 1.9` or higher, `bash`.

Tested and working on Linux, OSX and Cygwin.

`tmux-resurrect` is idempotent! It will not try to restore panes or windows that
already exist.<br/>
The single exception to this is when tmux is started with only 1 pane in order
to restore previous tmux env. Only in this case will this single pane be
overwritten.

### Installation with [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) (recommended)

Add plugin to the list of TPM plugins in `.tmux.conf`:

    set -g @plugin 'trevin-j/tmux-resurrect-nvim'

Hit `prefix + I` to fetch the plugin and source it. You should now be able to
use the plugin.

### Manual Installation

Clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/trevin-j/tmux-resurrect-nvim.git ~/clone/path

Add this line to the bottom of `.tmux.conf`:

    run-shell ~/clone/path/resurrect.tmux

Reload TMUX environment with: `$ tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf`.
You should now be able to use the plugin.
